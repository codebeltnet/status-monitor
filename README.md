## Application

This is the repository for the Status Monitor application.

It is structured to follow an opinionated take on Hexagonal-, Clean-, and Onion- Architecture in general while providing an API tailored to support non-blocking RESTful APIs where actual work is offloaded to one or more worker services. Ideal for Microservices and the likes hereof.

Includes a complementary repository with supporting infrastructure definitions and deployments for these environments:

- LocalDevelopment
- Development
- Staging
- Production
